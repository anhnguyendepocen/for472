Outline of Book 

Chapter 1: Forestry Data Sets and R

    - Pretty much keep the same as what is currently in Chapter 1
    - Think it would be useful to elaborate the Section 1.4 Looking Forward.
      Specifically address the complications that will arise with each dataset, 
      and then address the specific chapters in the text when we will address 
      such problems. 
    - Incorporate a couple paragraphs of why forestry people should learn R, then include
      instructions for installing R and RStudio (i.e. the first two sections of 
      the current chapter 2). 
    - Note that I think the rest of the current Chapter 2 can be incorporated
      either in the basic intro to stats chapter, or we can include little 
      R Tips in boxes throughout the text (i.e. good variable names, use of <- vs =, etc.). 

Chapter 2: Basic Introduction to Statistics

    - Descriptive statistics, empirical distributions, central tendency measures, 
      measures of dispersion
    - Along the way, describe how to use R as a basic calculator, then show how 
      descriptive statistics can be computed, perhaps show some histograms as well. 
      Can adapt current section 2.3.2 that uses the FEF data set. 
    - Perhaps can go through a fairly lengthy example of making a histogram or 
      something, and along the way can introduce using R Scripts. 
    - Confidence intervals, precision, accuracy, standard error

Chapter 3: Data Structures in R

    - The current Chapter 4. Don't think much needs to change. Perhaps can integrate
      a couple larger examples. 
    - I think we could combine the current Chapter 7 (Working with Data Sources) into 
      this chapter. That should give the basic tools necessary to read in and manipulate 
      data in R. 

Chapter 4: Manipulating data with dplyr

Chapter 5: Data Visualization

    - A plotting chapter. Not currently in there, but based on FOR875 people seemed 
      to really ejoy the plotting chapter. People may intially struggle with the coding
      and manipulating data structures at the beginning and not exactly see the relevance
      and lose interest, so perhaps a chapter where they can learn how to make nice plots
      of their data will help keep interest and motivation for learning R high. 
    - Not sure if it would be best to do ggplot or graphics, or a combo. 
    - Think could be a useful way to combine reading data in, manipulating it with dplyr, 
      and then producing some useful visualizations to share with colleagues. 
    - Could also be a good spot to work with Hunter's package 

Chapter 6: Simple Random Sampling

- Thinking maybe could separate out SRS and then introduce functions and programming
  in this chapter as well instead of separating out into it's own chapter. 

Chapter 7: Further Sampling Strategies

Chapter 7.5: Functions and Programming
    - Perhaps can combine this with the chapter on sampling strategies? 

Chapter 8: Spatial Data Visualization and Analysis

Chapter 9: Basic Regression and Kriging ???  

    - Thought this could be a good way to combine everything, not sure kriging would be
      necessary to include, just a thought. 

Chapter 10: Databases  ???
