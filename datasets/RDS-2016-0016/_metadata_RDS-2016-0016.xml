      <abstract>This data package includes felled tree biomass by tree component for four hardwood species of the central Appalachians sampled on the Fernow Experimental Forest (FEF), West Virginia. A total of 88 trees were sampled from plots within two different watersheds on the FEF. Hardwood species sampled include Acer rubrum, Betula lenta, Liriodendron tulipifera, and Prunus serotina, all of which were measured in the summer of 1991 and 1992. Data include tree height, diameter, as well as green and dry weight of tree stem, top, small branches, large branches, and leaves.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data were collected to test whether the Brenneman et al. (1978) biomass equations were accurate for smaller diameter trees in support of a study comparing vegetation growth and nutrient status between an untreated and an artificially acidified watershed.

      <attraccr>Tree species was identified in the field by experienced forestry personnel. Tree component samples were labeled in a consistent manner and the labels double-checked before storage. Each sample was identified by watershed, year, species, tree component, and subsample code. Sample labels were carried through the entire laboratory process. Green weights were measured in the field to the nearest 1 gram and dry weights measured in the laboratory to the nearest 0.1 grams. Digital data were checked for accuracy by the project data manager.</attraccr>

        <methdesc>Five trees from each of four species (black cherry [Prunus serotina], red maple [Acer rubrum], black birch [Betula lenta], and yellow-poplar [Liriodendron tulipifera]) in the range of 5 to 9 inches diameter at breast height (dbh) were sampled from each watershed in July and August 1991. Six trees from each of the same four species in the range of 1 to 4.9 inches dbh were sampled from each watershed in June 1992.

The permanent growth plot centers were randomly selected as sampling points. At each selected plot (\Supplements\biomass_sample_locations.jpg), trees were selected in a band 50-75 feet from plot center (plot radius = 37.2 feet) beginning in a clockwise direction from North. For the larger dbh group, the first dominant or codominant trees encountered of the four selected species (maximum of one per species per plot) were selected. For the smaller dbh group, the goal was to select no more than three intermediate trees per species per plot. However more trees had to be selected from a plot for black cherry on watershed 3 (four trees) and yellow-poplar on watershed 7 (five trees) due to the species distribution within the watershed. When a species was not available on a plot it was chosen on an alternate plot.

Tree dbh (inches) and total height (feet) were measured before each tree was felled. All components of sampled trees were weighed in the field immediately after they were felled. Green weights were measured to the nearest 0.1 kilograms.

Trees were limbed and cut into 4-foot bolts to where the live crown began. Each bolt was numbered and weighed individually (stem field sample). One disk 1.5-inches thick was cut from the small end of each bolt. The disks were placed in individual plastic bags for nutrient and moisture content determinations. The remainder of the bole (top-wood above where the live crown began) was marked at one-quarter, one-half and three-quarter points, and then cut into convenient lengths and weighed (top field sample). Subsamples 2 inches in length were removed at each of the previously marked points for nutrient and moisture content determinations.

The severed branches were weighed separately for each side of the tree. All branches 0.5 inches and smaller in diameter were removed from the bole on each side of the tree and weighed (small branch field sample). Branches greater than 0.5 inches diameter on each side of the tree also were weighed (large branch field sample). Two samples of small branches and two samples of large branches were collected for nutrient and moisture content determinations from each side of the tree. For the large branches a 2-inch-long section of branch was collected at the one-third point of total branch length measuring from the bole.

Leaves were removed from each side of the tree and placed in large plastic bags and weighed. Immediately after weighing two subsamples were collected from each side of the tree crown for nutrient and moisture content determinations. All nutrient and moisture content subsamples – leaves, branches, top-wood, and bole disks – were placed in air-tight plastic bags carefully labeled by watershed, plot, species and component, and kept in a cooler with ice for transportation to the laboratory.</methdesc>

        <methdesc>Each subsample was weighed to the nearest 0.1 grams in the laboratory the same day it was collected. Subsamples were then oven-dried at 100 degrees Celsius until a consistent dry weight was reached.

Percent dry weight was calculated as dry weight divided by green weight for each subsample. Dry weight for each field sample was calculated as total green weight per sample multiplied by the percent dry weight of its corresponding subsample. Field sample dry weights were summed by component to determine total component dry weights. Both green and dry total woody material weights were the sum of stem, top and large and small branch weights.</methdesc>
      </method>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Field and laboratory data were recorded on data forms by hand and then entered into ASCII text files. Digital data were checked for accuracy by the project data manager. A Fortran program was used to summarize the green and dry weight data in kilograms by tree component for each sampled tree and calculate percent moisture by tree component. Whole-tree dry weights by tree component also were calculated by the Fortran program using the field-collected green weights and percent moisture for each tree component. Total green and dry weights for each tree and tree component were saved in an ASCII text file.</procdesc>
